# [STAR WARS QUIZ](https://pegrume88.github.io/star-wars-quiz/)

Star Wars has been one of the most popular franchises since the late 70s, with Movies and TV Series regulary being released. I decided to create a quiz that will test the users knowledge to see if they know as much as they think they know.




## Goals

* Create a fun interactive quiz that fans of Star Wars will enjoy playing.
* To make the quiz intuitive to use, and provides satisfying feedback for the user.
* Design a quiz that is aesthetically pleasing.
* To make the quiz responsive.

# Features

## Home page

The page follows the asthetics of star wars with a background image of deep space. The Star Wars Quiz title with the symbol of the Jedi order. The Font used was Orbitron. I chose this font style because of its Sci-fi look. I then added glowing shadow effect to make it stand out.

Below the Star Wars Quiz heading we have the start button that will link you to the quiz page. I used the neon collor effect for this try and create the effect of a lightsaber glowing. this is in keep with the sci-fi/Star Wars theme of the quiz.

On loading of the page there will be star wars music playing in the background and the curser has been changed to a lightsaber, this curser was obtained from [curser-4u](https://www.cursors-4u.com/star_wars/).

## Question page

The question page follows the same aesthetics as the home page with the deep space background and the orbitron font.
there is a question counter and a point scorer above the question. Below the question are four options for answers.
the is a hover effect to indicate wich option your curser is over. Once you have chosen your answer it either glows green for correct or red for incorrect. The green and red glow were created to match the glow of a light saber. The green indicating the color of the jedi and red indicating the color of the dark side.

Once the answer has been clicked you will be moved on to a new randomly selected question and the question counter will increment by 1 and the score if correct will increment by 10.

## End page

  Once you have completed all the questions you will be directed to the end page which will display your final score and give a link back to the home page.
  I kept a conisten style though out the pages to creat an aesthetic flow and to make the site cohesive.
